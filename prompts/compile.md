description: Compile the project journal PDF
---

Follow this workflow to compile the journal:

1) Ensure you are in the repo root.
2) Change into the journal directory: `cd project_journal`.
3) Run `./compile.sh`.
4) If compilation fails, inspect the error and keep working until it succeeds.
5) Report completion and confirm `project_journal/main.pdf` is updated.
